# PocketBook-
This is the code used to make pocketbook!
 Hello! I am Rishi Suresh a 13 year old starting 8th rade in the fall! I am a beginner coder, and this has been a big project for me, since I don't know much about coding. anyways, this is the 1.0 Premeire edition of PocketBook! This is mostly all the basics, and has no save function on your computer yet, but that along with others is for the future. I plan to make this so that multiple people can work on the same note, there can be a chat function so they can collaborate, a sticky note/ reminder function, and a cloud save function down the road. I would also like to make this mobile friendly, as well as easy to use, and taking up minimal space. Even if I don't win, I would suggest youleave suggestions and commnts for me so that I can improve.
 
 Thanks!
 Rishi Suresh
